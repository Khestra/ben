      <h2>Reflection Transcript</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Prince, and this is my reflection on the circulation of my Studio Exhibition Portfolio. Over the course of this semester, building this portfolio has helped me grow not only as a writer and content creator, but also as a student, collaborator, and future professional in the tech and design fields.</p>

      <p>My portfolio showcases a selection of multimodal projects that I feel best represent my creative growth and my ability to communicate effectively through different mediums. I chose to feature pieces that show a range of skills—from visual design and storytelling to web development and research-based writing. Each piece contributes to a cohesive narrative about who I am becoming as a designer and thinker: someone who is deeply reflective, curious, and intentional.</p>

      <p>Design played a huge role in connecting these works. I used a consistent visual theme throughout the site—simple layouts, accessible fonts, and a color palette that is easy on the eyes. These elements weren’t chosen randomly; they reflect my commitment to usability and inclusion. I also ensured that all images had alt-text, videos included captions, and navigation was intuitive—practices I learned through our coursework and feedback sessions.</p>

      <p>Peer feedback was instrumental in shaping both the content and structure of my portfolio. Through our class workshops, I learned that users often engage with design before text, and that first impressions really matter. Suggestions about clarity, image placement, and storytelling helped me refine my projects for a broader audience. Working with others taught me how to balance my own vision with external input—something I know will be crucial in any professional setting.</p>

      <p>I tried to embody the habits of practice we discussed in class, especially collecting and curating. Every piece in my portfolio was selected with intention, and I spent a lot of time considering not just what to include, but how to frame it. I engaged critically with feedback, contextualized my choices in reflective writing, and considered how each piece would circulate to audiences beyond the classroom.</p>

      <p>Looking forward, I see this portfolio as a living archive that I can adapt for different opportunities—whether it's applying for internships, collaborating with other creators, or showcasing my skills to potential mentors. It represents more than just coursework; it’s a reflection of my values, creativity, and growth.</p>

      <p>In all, this portfolio has helped me realize that composition isn't just about writing—it’s about designing experiences, connecting with people, and making ideas tangible. I’m proud of the work I’ve done, and I’m excited to continue building on this foundation.</p>
